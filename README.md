<h1>United States Air Quality Interavtive Map (In Progress)

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This project is intended to use Python to process large amounts of data from 1980-2024 about Air Quality data in the United States. The goal of this project is to make a user-friendly app through plotly that allows the user to viualize air quality data based on variable color change on a map of the United states with a color chart to determine higher/lower levels. This project is in progress.
